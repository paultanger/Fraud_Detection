      "<p>Writers and filmmakers need to understand their legal rights and how to defend themselves from those who may seek to exploit them. Production companies and distributors often know all the tricks of the trade, while writers and filmmakers know little about how to protect themselves. This seminar, geared towards both artists and attorneys representing artists, explains how writers and filmmakers can prevent problems from arising by properly securing underlying rights, and by encouraging the other party to live up to agreements by adding performance milestones, default penalties and arbitration clauses. In the event of a dispute, participants learn what remedies are available to enforce their rights. Related topics include creative approvals, typical compensation and terms of studio contracts, merchandising deals, and negotiating tactics and strategies. The seminar includes more than 100 pages of useful contracts, checklists, forms and materials.</p>\r\n",

       " 1114349: \"Writers and filmmakers need to understand their legal rights and how to defend themselves from those who may seek to exploit them. Production companies and distributors often know all the tricks of the trade, while writers and filmmakers know little about how to protect themselves. This seminar, geared towards both artists and attorneys representing artists, explains how writers and filmmakers can prevent problems from arising by properly securing underlying rights, and by encouraging the other party to live up to agreements by adding performance milestones, default penalties and arbitration clauses. In the event of a dispute, participants learn what remedies are available to enforce their rights. Related topics include creative approvals, typical compensation and terms of studio contracts, merchandising deals, and negotiating tactics and strategies.

That model was started in 1977 by\\r\\nthe initial Prison Arts Project, which used professional artists, writers, and\\r\\nperformers as teachers and role models of discipline, skill and commitment to\\r\\ngrowth and hard work.\\n\\xa0\\nParticipation in\\r\\nArts-in-Corrections correlates to a lower recidivism rate, thus significantly\\r\\nreducing costs for the state and helping people to stay out of prison upon\\r\\ntheir release. A university study found that participants in the AIC program\\r\\nhad a 27% lower recidivism rate than the general prison population. Ninety\\r\\npercent of inmates will return to life outside the prison walls, and arts and\\r\\neducational programming helps address the challenges of re-entry through public\\r\\ncollaboration and creative growth.

Tickets to attend are $20.00 in advance and $25.00 at the door.\\nThe NC4K fashion show is presented by Olentangy Pediatrics, Key Bank, Round 2, Miche Bag, and Knights of Columbus.\\nTo purchase tickets, make a donation, or\\xa0to find out more information\\xa0log onto www.catwalk4kids.com and to\\xa0find Nellie's fan page\\xa0on Facebook\\xa0search for Nellie's Catwalk for Kids.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nBackground Information:\\nNellie's Catwalk for Kids (NC4K) was started back in 2006 by Nellie Krumlauf when she was 16 years old in the efforts of bringing childhood cancer to the forefront. The organization started off as just a summer fashion show wanting to get local kids and teens involved in helping make a magical difference. NC4K has now evolved to a 501 C3 non-profit that has four main community events a year\\xa0including: a dance marathon, 5K run, golf outing, and the fashion show. In addition to community events NC4K has over 15 high school Nellie's Clubs all ran by upperclassmen. The first Nellie's Club was started back in 2009 by Jessica Soroky at Pickerington North High School; she is now the manager of all of the clubs and helping NC4K expand to other high schools. NC4K's mission is to actively help kids and teens and their families that are touched by cancer. The money raised from all of our events help us work in conjunction with Nationwide Children's Hospital Oncology Unit by supporting the families in every way possible. Funds raise also help us raise more awareness for pediatric cancer and grow the organization as a whole. NC4K's main goals are to inform communities of how they can help pediatric cancer families, to raise more funds for families with a child battling cancer, to empower kids, teens and\\xa0young adults to make a difference, to eventually expand outside of Ohio to help other families, and the ultimate goal of helping find a cure!\\n\\xa0\\nWays to get involved:\\nNC4K has many easy and fun ways to give back. The most popular way is to become a summer fashion show model, along with\\xa0starting a Nellie's Club at a high school to raise funds and awareness for NC4K. Other involvement opportunities include: volunteering at events, financial support, making fleece blankets for patients, collecting pop tabs for the hospital, hosting a fundraiser to benefit NC4K, and simply spreading the word.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\",\n",

Please register to come and we'll then send you further joining details. Both events are free, but we warmly welcome donations towards the venue hire and further work of Women on Fire. Thank you.\\n________\\nHelping women to become really effective decision makers includes their personal lives. This is often a matter of confidence and clout, both boosted by joining forces with other women.\\nWhere decisions are generally led by men and affect large chunks of society, engaging men in strenghtening their receptivity (the feminine principle) and the ability to listen without prejudice, works towards a true collaboration.\\nHence at the moment two different approaches and two separate TINDERBOX meetings. Please remember that the practices introduced at TINDERBOX are unusual. For some they're unusually powerful. Even if you think this is all very odd, there'll be something in it for you.\\nYou don't need to understand the language of TINDERBOX. It doesn't matter if your intellectual self dismisses or draws you back from reading this. Your body (without which your mind is after all somewhat adrift) needs the resources of the earth, the energy of the sun and the fire at the earth's core which helps to make our atmosphere. Engaging with those fundamentals, including gravity helps to make you feel at home in yourself, as yourself. And to feel a valued part of something.\\nCome for an adventure. It will be entirely pleasurable unless you want your existing criteria to define where you are going, or even more discomforting, are certain that you already know and want to be seen as a knower. Think childhood. Think unselfconscious happy discovery. There are untapped resources in each of us, often bundled up, judged and made unavailable by reason. We properly value our capacity for logic and clear-thinking. That part often gets the casting vote. But there's also a wise, instinctual self every bit as useful. This is a less subjective resource, an 'inner tuition' accessed through awareness of what governs our bodies and makes us all equal. It's therefore inclusive, not only of other people but of other forms of life.\\nCome to TINDERBOX to connect with the fire in the earth and in you. Come to experience a deeper rootedness, and the peace that arises. Come to contribute to the power of joined-up fire - the shared current flowing hip to hip in women, shoulder to shoulder in men.\\nEach Meeting\\nEach meeting will begin promptly at 7pm, and will begin with a short introduction. Then we'll move directly to the practice to connect individually and then collectively to core fire. THis is \\xa0so that any discussion comes from a shared experience of a great resource, and is the foundation for subsequent periods of silence and listening with alert stillness.\\xa0\\nAfter this there'll be a chance to meet others and speak one to one until the close of TINDERBOX at 9pm.\\nCheck out the film clips of the practice and the one minute silence (we've shortened it!) from our inaugural event at\\xa0http://womenonfire.co.uk/pg/pages/view/397/video\\nRegistration\\nPlease reserve a seat by registering above. Then we'll email you details of the venue and some local cafes where you can carry on networking after 9pm. Please respect the place that you have put your name to. If you've researved a seat and then can't come, please let us know so that we can reallocate your place to someone else. Thanks,\\nBecause of the format, it's vital that you are there on time.

This environment to boost self confidence, learn social interation that is simple and basic to apply (in all areas of your life) even out side of the event. You will also learn how to gently \\r\\nand safely push your ‘comfort zone’ boundaries to explore your \\r\\nintimate self and how to share that with one another.\\nAs human beings we not only have a deep desire to connect with one another ....but an innate \\r\\nneed for affection, intimacy and most of all touch. To touch and be touched.\\n in a 'non' sexual way.\\nIt is here at Cuddle Party that we show you how this can be non sexualy as we create an environment that recreates a child like state. One that promotes innocence and light heartedness and pure in intent. It's really simple!\\nFor some reason Western Culture both socially and culturally collasped and melded together that being loving, affectionate and/or \\r\\nintimate toward one another as being sexualised. Creating mixed messages of\\r\\n sexual attraction. Which in parcel, trigger many forms of inherent \\r\\nand/or learnt fears, concerns, anxieties, insecurities etc.\\nAt Cuddle Party you will learn how to take complete responsibility \\r\\nfor your self and your needs via open, clear & succinct communication skills, which we will show you.. You will be \\r\\nrespected and will respect one another regardless of your current \\r\\ndisposition. You will learn how to be \\r\\nspecifically about your own personal needs and desires..\\nAll of which is founded by the Cuddle Party guidelines (aka the rules) \\r\\nwhich bring together a relative set of like minded strangers ‘all on the \\r\\nsame page’, to very quickly become not so strange towards one another.\\nThis joyous event will have you laughing and crying. Certainly one event you will never forget.\\nThere’s something very magical, about Cuddle Party that has been known to be both therapeutic and healing all packed into this usually two - three hour playspace.\\n\\xa0\\nIMPORTANT! This is Closed Event. It's extremely important that ALL attendees arrive on time that all be on the same page.

Deb was born in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in North Miami Beach, Florida. A music aficionado from a young age, she was \"discovered\" at the age of 16 by producer Pretty Tony at a Miami record store where she was working. While Debbie had no formal training in singing, she had been singing most of her life. Pretty Tony told her that he liked the way she spoke and asked if she could sing, and she answered yes. They recorded \"When I Hear Music,\" which she co-wrote with Pretty Tony in his studio the very next day. Released on the Jam Packed record label in 1984, the song has since become a staple in clubs and on dance and urban radio stations and mixshows. Other hits followed, including \"Lookout Weekend\", \"I Wanna Work It Out\", \"There\\'s A Party Going On\", \"I Wanna Dance,\" and a remake of Connie\\'s 1980s Latin freestyle classic \"Funky Little Beat\".\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Ride a beautiful, gentle horse along a sandy Florida beach lined with palm-trees. Soon, you\\'ll make your way deeper into the warm waters of Palma Sola Bay to learn the secrets of horse-surfing and horse-skiing! Horseback riding on the beach is the ultimate vacation treat that won\\'t soon be forgotten!\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\\nI don\\'t see a beach ride scheduled on the day/time when I want to ride. Should I schedule a Private Ride?\\xa0This popular and unique riding experience sells out fast, and once an event sells out we take it off the website. The dates and times you see are what we have available. All times are based on low-tide. Who can participate in the beach experience?\\xa0\\xa0Almost anyone can do this because we can adjust the ride depending on your experience level. We make it wicked fun for Barneys and expert riders alike. We accept children as young as 3. We welcome the disabled. Our only restriction is that you must weight under 220 lbs. Sorry, no exceptions.\\nI know how to ride, do I have to have a guide?\\xa0If you can ride like a Comanche we\\'ll let you ride on the beach without a guide, but everyone has a guide in the water. Sweet!Will I ride bareback?\\xa0 Yes, but not like that! We use bareback pads which are more comfy than sitting directly on the horse (but no stirrups). English and western-style saddles are available, but cannot be taken into the salt water.\\xa0Can you accommodate more than 4 riders?\\xa0 Yes, but not at the same time. \\xa0If you have 8-15 riders in your party, we can organize a\\xa0weapons-grade\\xa0beach party for you. Call 941-907-7272 for details.Can Junior ride with an adult? Yes. But there are restrictions. The adult must be an accomplished rider with years of riding instructions. The combined weight of the adult and child must be under 200 lbs. The child must hold a ticket. No free lunch, baby!Are Photographs and Videos permitted?\\xa0 Professional-quality still images and videos are available above. You are also welcome to take your own photographs and/or bring your own photographer; however, there\\'s an extra fee if your photographs are for commercial purposes.Are spectators allowed? Spectators are always welcome. There is a public sidewalk parallel to the beach. The beach is open to the public.Are dogs allowed? Yes! Palma Sola Bay is a pooch-friendly beach.Horse Surfing - If you weigh less than 150 lbs and wish to try standing up on your horse (totally optional), your guide will teach you how to hang ten like a local for no extra charge. Horse Surfing was invented right here at Palma Sola Bay in Bradenton, FL! (see video below)\\nRefunds - All tickets are non-refundable. Please don\\'t hate us.Ticket Availability - To control quality and safety, we only sell 4 tickets for each event. If you have 8-15+ people in your group, we can throw a bitchin\\' beach party. Just give us a call at 941-907-7272.\\nDirections - We ride at Palma Sola Bay. There isn\\'t an official address but the map coordinates are 27º 29\\' 46.24\" N 82º 38\\' 43.25\" W. We\\'re right on Manatee Avenue, about 4 miles east of Homes Beach and 11 miles west of I-75. You\\'ll be looking for a truck and horse trailer.\\nDo I need to print my tickets? Nah, just make sure you know when/where to go.\\nRain/Cold - We reserve the right to delay/postpone/cancel your ride due to crappy weather or for any other rieason. If we are forced to cancel your ride due to weather or for any other reason, we will give you a rain check that can be used up to one year later.\\xa0After that they start to get moldy. \\xa0You must be present and ready to ride at your scheduled time of departure to be eligible for a rain check. \\nWhat timeshould I be there? Plan to check-in about 15 minutes before your ride to sign release forms, ask questions, and get aquainted witour horses and staff. Please don\\'t be late for your ride. Your ticket is only good for the times stated on your ticket. Your ride will end at the scheduled time reguardless of your arrival time.\\nHow much should I tip?\\xa0- Excellent question. If you\\'re a cheap-skate or you have a really lousy time, $0-5 per person. If you\\'re a working stiff or student like us, then $10-20 per person is average. If you have a truly awesome experience, then $25-50 per person is normal. If you flew into SRQ on a Gulfstream G550, then $100 each is very cool. All tips, no matter how small, are greatly appreciated.\\n',\n",

You were born to live this dream, and your dream is within reach! The key is to have the proper instruction and tools to help you shift your mindset so that you can actively turn your dream into your reality.\\n\\nThis program includes both the 3-hour workshop and a 60-minute follow-up private coaching session to further clarify your purpose and the path to get you there.\\n\\nThe 3-hour intensive course will guide you to:1) Examine your life systematically to help clarify your purpose2) Identify your greatest gifts, strengths and possibilities for your lifetime3) Analyze your life to help you see your truth and greatest potential4) Understand how to release unconscious fears and blocks each time they come up5) Learn key principles to build courage and maintain determination6) Communicate your visions effectively in conversation and to a group7) Develop a step-by-step action plan to turn your dream into reality8) Coach yourself consistently to maintain an effective mentality during your journeyRachel inspires her audiences while explaining many abstract concepts and ideas that she has applied to her own life to realize her own dreams.

I went to this workshop with an open mind, not knowing to expect, but never did I expect it to move me the way that it did and to so thoroughly re-center my focus. I’ve been a lot more driven in my career and in seeking the right kind of work for myself since that day.

This allows you to work together with the coach to fine-tune an action plan that is ultimately created by you. The coach facilitates your process by asking key questions which, as you answer them, will guide you to seeing yourself and your vision more clearly, and get you focused on your optimal direction and path.\\n\\nRegistration is required, so register today if you are ready and willing to take on the challenge of discovering and living the path to your purpose!\\n\\n\"To realize one\\'s destiny is a person\\'s only obligation.\" -- Paulo Coelho, International bestselling author\\n\\nLive your purpose, Live in peace.',\n",

The well-being, productivity and even the ability to effectively communicate can be hampered by bad acoustics. But the conversation of acoustics doesn't stop there. How many times has a meeting, or a good-nights-sleep been interrupted by outside noise? Acoustic design even impacts the exterior design of our home and other buildings.

       " 3638196: '\\nThe Lambrettas\\n\\xa0\\nThe Lambrettas\\xa0came into being in the late 70s.\\xa0Doug Sanders\\xa0and\\xa0Jez Bird\\xa0were playing in a band called Shakedown (who are still going strong today). They were looking for direction in keeping with their musical tastes, so split from Shakedown to start something new.\\n\\xa0Both could sing and play guitar and set about writing. They were soon joined by like minded drummer\\xa0Paul Wincerand bassist\\xa0Mark Ellis. Doug says: “There were only a few Mods locally in Brighton and Hastings and we had no idea there would be a revival on the scale that it grew into. That’s when we decided to call the band\\xa0The Lambrettas\\xa0to make it as obvious as possible, so that people would know what we were about.” They suffered some criticism later on for their name but these were early days. They always maintained (and still do), that a band should be judged on their music first and foremost.\\n\\xa0They soon realised there were other bands around like their neighbours The\\xa0Teenbeats from Hastings, who are also still around and played with the Lambrettas at the 100 Club in London in 2009, as they did in 1979 at London’s Dublin Castle.\\n\\xa0Their first gig was on Hastings Pier with 4 other bands, and promoter Peter Haines offered them management. After a few months of gigs they were signed to Elton John’s Rocket Records and released their first single\\xa0Go Steady. This got them some airplay and soon they were gigging more regularly. The mod revival had now grown, and clothes that they used to fight for in the charity shops were now on sale in the High Street. Their second single was\\xa0Poison Ivy, the song they are most remembered for, as it spent a long time in the charts. Soon after, their album\\xa0Beat Boys in the Jet Age\\xa0was released and also spent several months in the charts.

       " 3801472: 'The Yoga Seed Collective is proud to present\\xa0a special intimate performance by New York based independent singer/songwriter Chris Pureka!\\xa0 \\nDoors at 6 PM, show at 7 PM.\\n\\xa0\\nBiography\\nChris Pureka is a breath of fresh air in an age of fleeting success and temporary notions. She is an artist of substance, armed with a sharp eye for oft-missed details and an emotional intelligence that can switch from withering to compelling with a subtle inflection. On her third release, How I Learned To See In The Dark set to hit via Sad Rabbit Music /ADA on April 13, Pureka expands on her distinct and beautiful melodies exploring broader musical soundscapes all the while maintaining the stunning vocals and distinct guitar work she is known for.\\nWith her 2004 debut LP, Driving North, Pureka started a career as a touring troubadour and began building an impressive fan base from the ground up: a cult following that started in her native New England and steadily grew to a national level. Fans and critics alike were drawn to the signature voice that somehow makes heartbreak sound desirable and her acute attention to lyrical detail, while others lauded her aptitude for crafting guitar parts that speak for themselves. The Boston Globe raved that \"[she] is such a gifted guitar player and singer that you have to listen to each song twice, once for her guitar playing and again for her passionate lyrics about love, loss and hope.\" With her 2006 follow-up, Dryland, Pureka further expanded on the emotional topography she charted earlier in her career by continuing to tour extensively playing 200+ shows a year and gathering supporters city by city, show by show and fan by fan. \\nWhile maintaining the unique alchemy of longing, loss and hope this virtuoso sets to music, there is a sonic adventurism on How I Learned to See in the Dark that marks a new stage in Pureka’s musical evolution. This is aided by Pureka’s choice of co-producer and longtime friend, Merrill Garbus (4Ad’s tUnE-YaRds). In addition to enjoying the comfort that comes with working with someone you’ve known since middle school, Garbus brought to the table her signature quirky recording techniques and alternative instrumentation, helping Pureka shift her sound into as-yet uncharted territory. This record boasts a newfound edginess, coupled with a more abstract sound and a musical depth and complexity that shines through each track, all the while maintaining the space and creative instrumentation Pureka is known for.\\nStandout track, “Landlocked”, showcases Pureka’s technical prowess with the finger-picking style that won her so many accolades on Dryland while “Broken Clock” is the rhythm driven, heavy hitter bound to be on your next break up mix. “Wrecking Ball” mixes a playful quirkiness in production with an underlying paced anger, laced with twangs of percussive guitar. Album closer, “August 28th” is the deep breath following the emotional tumult that precedes it – a return to quiet contemplation for the writer and the listener: “I think the whole world needs a shoeshine/I think we’re all living proof.”\\nIt has taken years for Chris Pureka to arrive here, and each step has been as purposeful, as precise, and as unwavering as the music she makes.\\nhttp://www.chrispureka.com/newhome.htm\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0',\n",

       " 4292670: 'Gridspectives: Future and Aesthetics of the Energiewende\\nEverybody loves bridges. Most people hate grids. Why?\\nTimes are changing\\u2028\\nWe are amidst a profound transformation. The digitalisation manifesting itself in the world wide web of information has not just changed the way we work and live, but also the way we perceive, feel and think. Our world has altered dramatically during the past 20 years due to new means of communication. Remember? How did it look and feel 20 years ago without Internet, mail and smartphone? \\nAs the fossil era is coming to an end, new ways use renewable energies to power our daily lives (more or less) directly has a similarly influential potential to transform our way of life. The next industrial revolution will be powered by renewables. The upcoming pan-European web of energy – some call it already the SuperSmart Grid – will combine up-to-date communication technologies with an upgraded grid infrastructure. What should it look and feel like? \\nPerceptions are changing\\n\\u2028Europe’s electricity grid was mainly built over 50 years ago. At times of general enthusiasm about industrial development, they signified progress and comfort. Engineers spread steel lattice pylons all over the landscape. They were the robust, functional and cheap solution at that time. Nowadays, power lines have a strong negative connotation amongst the general public. They are associated with heavy pollution resulting from energy giants’ pursuit of profit regardless of environmental and health consequences. New power line projects nurture strong public opposition, leading to long delays in planning procedures.\\nRenewables lead into a new era bringing power closer to the people. Energy becomes more democratic. More and more individuals, companies, communities, cities and regions will produce, consume, store, trade and manage energy over the planned pan-European Energy Web – just like user generated content on the internet we will see user generated energy. With this shift in sources, roles and activities individual and collective perceptions change. Does the existing grid infrastructure of the fossil era – omnipresent and omni-discussed as industrial lattice pylons – represent the new era of a smart and renewable power system? Can remnants of past industrial times become sexy, exciting, desirable messengers of a better renewable future? \\nDriving the Energiewende \\nTo avoid the power grid to become the bottleneck for the growth of renewable energies, many kilometres of new overhead lines will need to be installed in the near future. Current public acceptance projects focus on rational approaches: they provide transparency by providing background information to increase the general understanding and give room for discussions. However, they do not address a crucial aspect of grid lines: their visual effect.\\nFirst attempts to explore future pylon designs were undertaken by architects and designers in connection to various pylon design competitions carried out by European transmission system operators. The result: around 500 diverse and innovative pylon design concepts. Current grid discussions are either highly technological and bureaucratic or ideologically polarised. To make grids popular, the public debate has to become emotional, exciting, fresh and attractive. Grids have to become “my business” instead of “my problem”. \\nAfter an exciting panel discussion at the CeBIT the first Gridspectives Dialogue Forum \"Furture and Aesthetics of the Energiewende\" goes beyond gathering thrilling design proposals. It aims at triggering a constructive and future-oriented dialogue among stakeholders and the broader public, leading to a – why not even enchanting, and – visionary outlook on landscape integration of electricity grids.\\nOn 22 April will discuss at the 1st Gridspectives Dialogue Forum in Berlin:- How does public perception change ?- Why do we dislike grid infrastructure ?- How do designers, architects and landscaper approach grid planning ?- Which design options are currently discussed ?- What is happening internationally ?\\nYou can register here online or\\xa0with the Fax or Email form.

Superficially, everything runs normally in the underwater world of the Berger family, even when the head of one of the conservative parents is nearly obfuscated by the toothpaste-spit-spray during her morning routine, or when the father has to perform a little acrobatic trick before enjoying his breakfast toast in order to grab hold of the floating slice. There is the usual parent-child constellation: the reprimand, (Anna, sit up!) flute lessons following the middle-class educational canon; the boob tube as the parents’ somniferous evening entertainment, while the daughter sneaks out of the house to have a drink and dance a bit at her favorite bar.\\n\\xa0\\nThese Hammers Don’t Hurt Us by Michael Robinson\\n\\xa0Experimental\\n\\xa0\\nTired of underworld and overworld alike, Isis escorts her favorite son on their final curtain call down the Nile, leaving a neon wake of shattered tombs and sparkling sarcophagi.\\n\\xa0\\nCB by Doug Ischar\\n\\xa0Experimental\\n\\xa0\\nCB is an experimental biopic: its heroine, Charlotte Brontë.

A beautiful beach! Beautiful horses. Beautiful BeachHorse™ girls! Dolphins! You\\'ll even ride in the calm waters of Palma Sola Bay and learn how to HorseSurf™ and HorseSki™! Horsebackriding on the beach is the ultimate vacation treat that you will NEVER forget!\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\\nI don\\'t see a beach ride scheduled on the day/time when I want to ride. Should I call you to ask if there are any other available times?\\xa0 \\xa0 No. This popular and unique riding experience sells out fast, and once an event sells out, we remove it from the website. The dates and times you see on our website are all that we have available. All times are based on low-tide and are only on those days in which low tide occurs during daylight hours.   WARNING: Is there anyone else who does this?\\xa0 \\xa0 No. We have no legitimate competitors at the moment; however, we have heard someone is claiming to offer \"horseback riding tours of Anna Maria Island.\" They are taking people\\'s money and not showing up. Horses are not permitted on AMI\\'s beaches. We don\\'t know who they are.\\nWho can participate in the beach experience?\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0Almost anyone can do this because we can adjust the ride depending on your experience level. We make it fun for beginners and expert riders alike. Children as young as 3 years old can do this with no diminution whatsoever in the experience. We welcome the disabled. Our only restriction is that you must weigh under 300 lbs. Sorry, no exceptions. Most of our horses are limited to riders who weigh under 220 lbs.\\n I know how to ride, do I have to have a guide?\\xa0 \\xa0 If you are an \"expert\" rider we\\'ll let you ride on the beach without a guide, but everyone else has a guide. You will probably be riding a spirited Thoroughbred or Quarter Horse, bareback and bit-less. Unless you are truly and expert rider, it would be quite dangerous to do this without a guide.  Will I ride bareback?\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 On some horses we use bareback pads which are more comfy than sitting directly on the horse (but no stirrups). English and western-style saddles are available for $20, but cannot be taken into the salt water.\\xa0\\nWill I ride bit-less?\\xa0 \\xa0 Yes. Your horse will have a halter and a lead-line tied in a loop that you can hold like reins; however, there will not be a bit in the horse\\'s mouth.  How many riders can you accommodate?\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0We usually bring 8 horses to the beach. If you have 8-16 riders in your party, you can ride in two groups.\\xa0 If you have at least 8 riders in your party, we can organize a\\xa0weapons-grade\\xa0beach party for you. Call 941-907-7272 Ext. 3 for details.  Can a child ride with an adult?\\xa0 \\xa0 Yes. But there are restrictions. The adult must be an EXPERT rider with many years of riding experience. The combined weight of the adult and child must be under 220 lbs. The child must hold a ticket. No discounts. Sometimes we\\'ll allow children to ride double with one of our guides.\\n Are photographs and videos permitted?\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0Professional-quality still images and videos are available above. You are also welcome to take your own photographs and/or bring your own photographer; however, there\\'s an extra fee if your photographs are for commercial purposes.  Are spectators allowed?\\xa0 \\xa0 Spectators are always welcome. The beach is open to the public and there is a public sidewalk parallel to the beach.\\n Are dogs allowed?\\xa0 \\xa0 Yes! Palma Sola Bay is a pooch-friendly beach.\\nCan I try HorseSurfing™?\\xa0 \\xa0 Yes! If you weigh less than 150 lbs and wish to try standing on your horse in the water (totally optional), your guide will teach you how to hang ten like a local for no extra charge. HorseSurfing™ was invented by our founder, Tim Mattox, right here at Palma Sola Bay in Bradenton, Florida!\\n If something happens, can I get a refund?\\xa0 \\xa0 No. All tickets are non-refundable. Please don\\'t hate us. If we are forced to cancel/reschedule your ride due to foul weather or for any other reason, we will issue you a raincheck that is valid for at least one year; but, under no circumstances will we issue a refund.  How many riders can you accomodate?\\xa0 \\xa0 We usually bring 8 horses to the beach. Each horse does 2 rides. If you have more than 8 riders in your group, you will have to purchase your tickets in two groups. Just give us a call and we\\'ll help you sort it out. 941-907-7272 Ext. 3.\\nWhere are you located?\\xa0 \\xa0 We ride at Palma Sola Bay. The \"address\" is 8400 Manatee Ave W, Bradenton, FL 34209. This isn\\'t an official address but the map coordinates of where we park the truck and horse trailer are 27.49621,-82.64529. We\\'re right on Manatee Avenue, about 4 miles east of Homes Beach and 11 miles west of I-75. You\\'ll be looking for a truck and horse trailer.\\nWhat should we wear?\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0You will get wet from head-to-toe, so we always suggest swimmwear. You can wear sandals or flip-flops.\\nWhat should we bring with us?\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0We suggest the following:\\n\\nA parent or legal guardian must be on-hand to sign a release form for all participants under the age of 18. Otherwise, please\\xa0print out a release form\\xa0 \\xa0 and bring it with you.\\n\\n\\nTowels.\\nDry clothing to wear after your ride.\\nSunscreen.\\nA waterproof camera.\\nBinoculars.\\nExtra cash for tipping.\\n\\nDo I need to print my tickets?\\xa0 \\xa0Yes, if at all possible. If you cannot print your tickets, just bring a picture I.D.\\nWhat kinds of horses do you use?\\xa0 \\xa0 We started with polo ponies which are Thoroughbreds and Polo Argentino. We also have Paint Horses, Quarter Horses, and a few mixed-breed draft horses.\\nAre any of your horses for sale?\\xa0 \\xa0 Yes. We sell Certified\\xa0BeachHorse™ and other horses.\\xa0Certified\\xa0BeachHorse™\\xa0horses are highly trained kid-safe horses that will do everything a normal horse will do on dry land PLUS they will swim and behave well in the water!\\xa0For more information, call us at (941) 907-7272.\\xa0\\nWhat happens if it rains?\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0If we are forced to cancel your ride due to weather or for any other reason, we will give you a raincheck that can be used up to one year later.\\xa0Do not assume your ride is canceled merely because it is raining where you are. In Florida, it can be raining on one side of the street and sunny on the other. You must be present and ready to ride at your scheduled start of your ride to be eligible for a raincheck. If you are a \"no show\", you will forfeit your ride.\\n\\nWhat time should we be there?\\xa0 \\xa0 Plan to check-in 15-30 minutes before the scheduled start of your ride to sign release forms, ask questions, and get acquainted with our horses and staff. Please don\\'t be late for your ride. Your ticket is only good for the times stated on your ticket. Your ride will end at the scheduled time regardless of your arrival time.\\nHow much should I tip?\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0Excellent question. All gratuities, no matter how small, are greatly appreciated. Most people tip around $20/rider.\\nAre BeachHorse™\\xa0Franchise business opportunities afailable?\\xa0 \\xa0 Yes. For more information, call us at (941) 907-7272.\\xa0\\nIf you have additional questions and/or if you prefer to purchase your tickets over the phone, please call us at (941) 907-7272 Ext 3.\\n© 2012 Great World Adventures, LLC All rights reserved.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n',\n",

This immersive audio/visual event will take cues from the region's storied quality of light and creative legacy. One of White's earliest experiences creating light shows took place in Southampton in 1966, as a member of Bobb Goldsteinn's Lightworks team, at the waterfront nightclub, L'Oursin. By the following year in 1967, the Joshua Light Show was established and went on to international renown for creating multimedia environments.\\xa0Joshua White, dubbed the “forefather of VJ culture,” pioneered psychedelic visuals and liquid light shows for live music via his Joshua Light Show, which began performing at Bill Graham's Fillmore East in the late 1960s. White went on to design mind-bending optics for music shows with Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane, The Grateful Dead, the Doors, as well as artist Yayoi Kusama, among others. In 2004, Joshua teamed up with artist, Gary Panter and regenerated the full light show at Anthology Film Archives, New York. Over the next eight years, the show evolved with the participation of new collaborators and a highly creative relationship with musician, performer and producer, Nick Hallett. In addition to his fellow light artists at the time, Joshua began working with a different generation all of whom enjoy a shared live performance, light show vision.

       " 5013550: '16 Acres charts the \\xa0rebuilding of ground zero, one of the most architecturally, politically, and emotionally complex urban renewal projects in American history. From the beginning, the effort has been fraught with controversy, delays and politics. The struggle has encompassed eleven years, nineteen government agencies, a dozen projects and over $20 billion.\\nAside from the staggering engineering challenges of the site itself, a major complicating factor in the rebuilding of the World Trade Center is the sheer number of interested parties. Politicians, developers, architects, insurance companies, local residents, and relatives of 9/11 victims all profess a claim to the site and are often in conflict with one another. According to The New York Times, \"Where some saw lucrative real estate, others saw a graveyard. Where some saw Rockefeller Center or Lincoln Center or Grand Central Terminal, others saw Gettysburg.\"\\nWhat was once ground zero is now a frenzied construction site. Three thousand workers are building four of the tallest skyscrapers in America, an iconic - and complicated - train station, a performing arts center and a sacred memorial and museum. What will emerge in downtown Manhattan over the next few years will redefine the city - and the country - for generations.\\n16 Acres is the story of how and why this historic project got built. At the heart of the story is the dramatic tension between noblest intentions, the desire of everyone involved to \"get it right,\" and the politics, hubris, ego and ideology that is the bedrock of New York City. What does it say about us as New Yorkers, as Americans?\\nAs with all great urban projects, from the Pyramids to Rome\\'s Colleseum to Rockefeller Center, a small group of powerful people will dictate the outcome. With inside access to the project and these key players, 16 Acres tells the story behind the headlines. Who are these men and women? What motivates them? How will their personalities shape the project? And, ultimately, will it succeed? The film also follows the dramatic rush to complete the memorial in time, and the key players as they prepare to converge on the site for the 10th anniversary.',\n",

He grew up learning to prepare, know, and love not just ordinary food, but great food. In fact, it was this early passion for wholesome cuisine that led him into the retail advertising industry. In 2008, Brian, his business partner, and a Swiss-born chef (who is a member of the American Culinary Federation) founded a successful brokerage firm that creates new items for a number of national retailers and shopping clubs. You may have even seen Brian on NBC, FOX, CBS, ABC, and QVC talking about the benefits of adopting an all-natural diet. His advertising tenure has also included working with the following companies: The Kroger Company, Robert Mondavi Wines, Idaho Potatoes, Hillshire Farms, Red Lobster, Sam’s Club, and other well known food/beverage brands. Sometime over the course of working with these companies, Brian was appointed the Director of Marketing for Cedarlane Natural Foods, the second largest frozen organic food company in the nation. While at the helm of Cedarlane, he sold the first “made-with-organic” frozen line that Wal-Mart ever carried. Additionally, he worked one-on-one with Dr. Barry Sears, the author of the New York Time’s Best Selling Book The Zone Diet. The Cedarlane Team and Dr. Sears advanced the development and launch of the Zone Diet frozen meals. These meals adhered to the rigorous standards set forth by Dr. Barry Sears in The Zone Diet and other books that he has written over the years. Brian eventually became the spokesperson for the entire Zone Diet frozen line, appearing with Dr. Barry Sears on several national and local mediums. Today, Brian lives in Denver, Colorado, with his lifelong partner. They have celebrated being together for over sixteen years. They are also the proud owners of two adopted dogs, Weimer, a Weimaraner, and Zoe, a Dalmatian.\\xa0\\xa0\\nSusan Algert, PhD, R.D.University of California Cooperative Extension\\xa0• \\xa0Nutrition,\\xa0Family, and Consumer Sciences AdvisorTopic: Understanding the Gluten-Free Diet\\n\\nDr. Algert curently works for the University of California Cooperative Extension in Santa Clara County managing 1 million in nutrition education contracts from the US Department of Agriculture.

The tag, that most reviled and persecuted form of graffiti, is seldom appreciated for its raw beauty and skeletal letter forms. The casual viewer seldom discerns the difference between entry level and advanced hand styles. Within the pages of\\xa0Flip the Script, author Christian Acker systematically analyzes historic hand styles by collecting the work of writers from the most influential American cities and searching for the origins and commonalities that connect people, places and times. While distilling years worth of interviews with graffiti writers from all over the country, intersecting tales emerge that reveal a web of unwitting connections and influences.\\xa0Flip the Script\\xa0has captured a representation of geographic differences within contemporary folk-art history; a history rapidly becoming muddied by internet culture. Acker presents the lettering samples in a clean, chronological format, for the first time giving the material a formal treatment evocative of classical calligraphy manuals and typography books.

       " 7261497: 'There is something inherently beautiful about natural light. It can be soft and warm, or hard and unforgiving, or even have a sort of melancholy to it. These are the areas we will be looking at in this course.\\nFashion and Beauty photography make use of natural light in many ways. A recent viewing of Vogue (October, 2012) reveals many natural light photography shots by up and coming and well established photographers. The techniques are not hard to understand, but still require the finesse and deliberate approach that is required when using artificial lighting.\\nWe will look at natural light from all angles; full sun, modified sun, shade and moody, emotional light.\\nWe will build some inexpensive modifiers for natural light, and also show how to correctly use white reflectors, silver and gold reflectors, scrims, mirrors, and more. These tools are not expensive, but the results they give can be astounding.\\nThe natural light fashion/beauty photography course is divided into 12 lectures, each running approximately 30 minutes. There is a workbook, plans for building a scrim and large reflector, and lots of videos.\\nMost lectures include a shoot with the gear we are using, a Photoshop tutorial, the PSD file for viewing and a look at how the final images were selected. Looking at the images as they are shot, and then edited, is very powerful as a learning tool.\\nIf you are interested in portraiture, fashion, beauty or glamour, this natural light photography course will open your eyes to the very cool ways you can use natural light to make your images.\\nThe beauty photography course is suited to any level of photographer. I recommend a light meter, although we will also show you ways to use your camera meter as we go. A couple of stands would also be a good addition to your natural light arsenal.\\nThis class also has over two hours of bonus content, with new content being added in May 2013 and June 2013.',\n",

Though she had no concept of how far they would go, Freda had faith in The Beatles from the beginning, and The Beatles had faith in her. History notes that The Beatles were together for 10 years, but Freda worked for them for 11. Many people came in and out of the band's circle as they grew to international stardom, but Freda remained a staple because of her unfaltering loyalty and dedication. As the Beatles' devoted secretary and friend, Freda was there as history unfolded; she was witness to the evolution - advances and setbacks, breakthroughs and challenges - of the greatest band in history. In GOOD OL' FREDA, Freda tells her stories for the first time in 50 years. One of few films with the support of the living Beatles and featuring original Beatles music, the film offers an insider perspective on the beloved band that changed the music industry.\",\n",

How can you achieve constant, incremental improvement? How can you prioritize decisions in a program? Do not miss this unique opportunity to learn how your organization can reach its potential! \\xa0 \\xa0 Why is a Fund Development Audit Tool vital for fundraising \\xa0 \\xa0 performance? The gap between the expertise of fundraising professionals and the expectations of their Board has increased substantially. The audit is a tool of reflection and strategic improvement and is based upon recognized best practice and standards of operational excellence. Its intent is to nurture exploration into better ways of going about the business of fundraising; to support constant, incremental improvement; to enable better decision-making about where to start, what priorities to address first and how best to achieve your objectives to move forward.\\nSeminar fee includes a copy of G. Mallabone & K. Balmer ‘The Fundraising Audit Handbook’, which is essential pre-reading for the seminar ($30 value).\\nExcercising Your Ask Muscle\\nEffective Face-to-Face Major Gift Solicitation Techniques\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0 Speaker: Guy Mallabone, MA, CFRE Knowing when and how to ask is the most essential weapon in any effective fundraiser’s arsenal. Ultimately gift fundraising means asking someone for money face to face. Not a natural thing in many ways, but if you are going to be successful in fundraising, you need to be successful in major gift solicitation. Struggling to find the best way to ask for money? Not sure how to get to the point of asking? Looking for the correct words? Participants will learn the strategic overview of major gift solicitation; review the elements that influence a decision; examine the psychology of a successful ask and the secrets to success; and have fun participating in role play.\\nABC\\'s of Prospect Research\\nExploring & Implementing the Basics of Best Practice\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0 Speaker: Tania Brandstrom, MA, CFRE Do you look at the success of mega campaigns, securing multiple transformational and leadership gifts, and wonder how to achieve similar results for your organization? These organizations have two critical items in common: they have fundraising staff dedicated to asking for these gifts, and the team is supported with solid and timely prospect research. Even for a smaller shop, implementing some basic prospect management practices can focus limited resources and make the most of the time with your donors. Together participants will explore the basics of prospect research, including an overview of research tools and practices to be applied for immediate results. Discussion also explores the changing role of prospect research: moving from a response-driven profile generator, to providing actionable intelligence throughout the development cycle.\\n\\xa0 \\xa0 -------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSpeaker Bios\\nE.H.

There are many message delivery styles and therefore many techniques for recieving accurate communication. Once recieved, the listening process is only half complete. The listener must then apply an acquired skill set to analyze the words relative to the message. Are they the same? Are they different? Is there a hidden message? Are there disabilities on either end of the communication which is thwarting success?\\n\\xa0\\nObjectives:\\n 1. Increase patience in listening.\\n 2. Create listening as an adventure.\\n 3. Enhance listening skill set.\\n 4. Enlighten as to speaking and listening disabilities.\\n\\xa0\\nApproach:\\nThe entire class is interactive. A series of analogies will be created for long term retention of materials and principles. Each class member will leave with an enlarged tool kit of listening skills and insights.',\n",

It can be especially difficult as individuals with autism age and certain play activities are no longer age appropriate or socially valid. In addition, it may be challenging to teach age-appropriate play and leisure activities given a learner’s interest in repetitive or stereotypic behavior. The good news is the field of applied behavior analysis offers a wide range of teaching strategies to improve play and leisure skills. Programming for play and leisure activities often requires creativity and modification of activities to meet a learner’s skills and abilities. This presentation will provide an overview of a variety of play and leisure activities that can be adapted or modified for learners with autism.

They’re not one of us---and especially not one of our heroes. So when the newspaper reports that, for example, Peter Martins, the ballet master of the New York City Ballet, was briefly charged with assaulting his wife (the charge was dropped), we are startled. When we become privy to the photos of her bruised and battered face, we are confused and jolted. This is not the star we know and love. This is not supposed to happen, (Dutton, 1995, p. 5). Intimate relationship violence is a very real phenomenon, one that until\\nthe women’s movement was very much ignored (Walker, 1979). Many perpetrators of domestic violence do not manifest violent behavior outside of the home (Dutton, 1995; Walker, 1979). It is the dependency and vulnerability required of the intimate relationship that evokes unacknowledged feelings of childhood shame (Dutton, 1995). Unable to identify and work through this uncomfortable affective state perpetrators of domestic violence react with rage against the intimate other.\"\\n\\nThis is a critically sound but uncomfortable and often disquieting examination of the research and writing around intimate relationship violence. Jacquie looks at the difference between shame and guilt and how empathy relates to both of these experiences.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Click on the images above for more details about Jacquie\\'s books.\\n\\n\\nDr. Jacqueline Simon Gunn is a Clinical Psychologist and Author of “In the Therapist’s Chair”. In addition to her private practice in Manhattan, Dr. Gunn is the Psychology Internship Training Director and Clinical Supervisor of the Trauma Program at the nationally recognized Karen Horney Clinic. Dr. Gunn has one M.A. in Phenomenological Psychology from Duquesne University, another M.A. in Forensic Psychology from John Jay College of Criminal Justice and her Doctorate of Psychology in Clinical Psychology from Miami Institute of Psychology. She also completed a two-year certificate program to specialize in Eating Disorders, Addictions and Compulsivity at The William Alanson White Institute.\\n\\nPlease visit www.drjacquelinegunn.com for more information.\\n\\n\\nEvent format\\n\\xa0\\nJacquie will present a synopsis of her research in a 45 minute presentation which will include distinguishing the difference between shame and guilt and how empathy relates to the two. There will also be examples of how this is experienced and/or reveals itself in the clinical setting.\\n\\nWe will then take a 15 minute break which will be followed by up to 45 minutes where Jacquie will take questions.\\xa0\\n\\nJohn Wilson will host this event using a Skype video link that will be streamed live to our website.

Eighty-six percent of the purchasing power in this country is in the pockets of women. Well, let’s use it.\"\\n- Pat Mitchell, CEO Paley Center for Media\\nThe media can be an instrument of change: it can maintain the status quo and reflect the views of the society or it can, hopefully, awaken people and change minds. I think it depends on who’s piloting the plane.”\\n- Katie Couric, Journalist\\n\\xa0\\nLike drawing back a curtain to let bright light stream in, Miss Representation (90 min; TV-14 DL) uncovers a glaring reality we live with every day but fail to see. Written and directed by Jennifer Siebel Newsom, the film exposes how mainstream media contribute to the under-representation of women in positions of power and influence in America. The film challenges the media’s limited and often disparaging portrayals of women and girls, which make it difficult for women to achieve leadership positions and for the average woman to feel powerful herself.\\nIn a society where media is the most persuasive force shaping cultural norms, the collective message that our young women and men overwhelmingly receive is that a woman’s value and power lie in her youth, beauty, and sexuality, and not in her capacity as a leader. While women have made great strides in leadership over the past few decades, the United States is still 90th in the world for women in national legislatures, women hold only 3% of clout positions in mainstream media, and 65% of women and girls have disordered eating behaviors.\\nStories from teenage girls and provocative interviews with politicians, journalists, entertainers, activists and academics, like Condoleezza Rice, Nancy Pelosi, Katie Couric, Rachel Maddow, Margaret Cho, Rosario Dawson and Gloria Steinem build momentum as Miss Representation accumulates startling facts and statistics that will leave the audience shaken and armed with a new perspective.\\n\\xa0\\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/6gkIiV6konY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>',\n",

They are driven by a single undeviating goal: total domination of the entertainment universe. In the war that rages between staid, boring comedians of the past, and the newer, sleeker, more technologically advanced DeceptiComics the DC are will serve as the next battle ground.\\nDillon Stevenson is a comedian and writer based out of New York City. He’s performed stand-up at New York Comedy Club, Comix, Broadway Comedy Club and Gotham Comedy Club and other venues in NYC. As a co-founder of the comedy group G.R.I.T.S. he’s written, directed and performed in sketch shows off Broadway & at benefits and events throughout the city. With microphone in hand (a light saber would have been preferred ) Dillon is taking the New York comedy scene by storm.\\xa0\\nGordon Baker-Bone is a stellar comedian who is regularly booked for shows all over NJ, CT, NYC, AND PA. His comedy can be described as a clever and witty that connects with people on all levels. Baker-Bone\\'s thought provoking style is smart, fun and leaves you laughing until you cry He was winner of the 2011 NJ Comedy Fest, and is Co-Writer \"Hater-Bot\" http://bit.ly/jNq0wG\\nHaywood Turnipseed wants you to know that that is his real name, and he would be happy to tell you about it. Operating out of the DC/Maryland area, Haywood\\'s comedy is an enthralling mix of the sublime and the intellectual. He isn\\'t afraid to use out-of-the-blue pop culture references to discuss any subject, and he does it seamlessly. If you don\\'t laugh uproariously and learn a little something about the world when Haywood is on stage, you have let yourself down.\\nJohn Minus is a comedian, writer, and all-around great guy who lives and breathes his home state of New Jersey. He has been described as having a sense of humor “darker than his skin” by racist comedy critics. He refers to his style as “Tragi-Comedy” referring to his torrid mix of the dark and light sides of life. The result is an entertainment experience that stimulates all areas of the emotional palate. Robert Klein once informed him that he was not at all horrible so he continued his fledgling comedy career nonplussed, no pun intended. Eschewing traditional Black Comedian tropes, John has never dressed in drag. Well, rarely dresses in drag.\\nMike Brown is a comedian and writer from Harlem, New York. He’s performed at Caroline’s Comedy Club, Stand Up NY, Laugh Lounge, EastVille Comedy Club, and other venues all over New York. He also hosts events, including one at SUNY where he did a pretty awesome job. Really! He knows that because 128 audience members became his Facebook friend afterward—and we all know how hard it is to get Facebook friends. For the record, Mike Brown loves comedy much more than writing about himself in the third person.\\nTickets are $15 at the door, $10 when purchased in advance.

There will be plenty of built in shelving and cabinetry so serve the teaching function. The dining space will have beautiful entrances to the outdoors toward the kitchen, the garden and the residential area.\\n\\nThis new building is an important and exciting step for the Panya community.\\xa0 The community was able to raise over $10,000 in a fundraiser to help make this building all it could be. We are bringing in a crew of experienced builders to help with various aspects of the project, so interns will have the opportunity to work with a number of different builders from a wide range of building backgrounds.\\nWe are hosting two one-month internships for this building process, as we expect the construction to last multiple months.\\xa0 The first internship (Jan 14 – Feb 10) will be focused primarily on adobe brick building:\\n\\nMaking Bricks\\nStacking Bricks\\nMaking mortor\\nBuilding Arches\\nInstalling Doors and Windows\\n\\nThese are the topics that will naturally come up in that phase of the building process.\\xa0 To give a more well rounded program, interns will be given an introduction to a number of other topics, most likely working on other building on sites, including:\\n\\nhistory of natural building\\nthe foundations and fundamentals of natural building\\nthe various types of natural building\\nthe building process\\nplasters and natural paints\\n\\nThe second one-month internship will be focused more the finish work of building, trying to get the sala to look the best it can.\\xa0 Its focus areas will include:\\n\\nPlastering and natural paints\\nWiring the sala for electricity (including 12v DC solar)\\nFinishing the Doors and windows\\nPlaning, sanding, and fine-tuning\\n\\nThese are the topics that will naturally come up in that phase of the building process, and we will be very much at the mercy of the building process as to what we are doing during this section.\\xa0 To give a more well rounded program, interns will be given an introduction to a number of other topics as well, including:\\n\\nhistory of natural building\\nthe foundations and fundamentals of natural building\\nthe various types of natural building\\nthe building process\\nmaking adobe bricks\\nmaking mortar\\nlaying bricks\\ninstalling windows, doors and other features.\\n\\nEach internship will have its own focus areas, and will flow with what is needed for the building project, but the instructors are also committed to make sure that interns get experience in a number of different areas of natural building.\\nCommunity Living:\\nAt the Panya Project we involve all present in the daily activities that keep a community rolling, from cooking and cleaning to feeding the animals and watering the garden. We value the opportunity to share what skills we have and to learn from all present.\\xa0 During this four-week internship, we will enjoy a healthy and balanced diet, intellectual stimulation, plenty of physical work, as well as time each evening to socialize, play music or take time for one’s self. The schedule for each day includes a morning work session, followed by lunch and a mid-day siesta and an afternoon work session. There will be two days of rest each week to help recharge the batteries for continued work. Three vegetarian meals per day will be provided. The evenings are an opportunity for us to socialize, watch videos & slide shows, have a potluck with neighbouring communities, or squeeze in another lesson or “skill share” activity. \\n\\nPermaculture Design:\\nThe Panya Project has been greatly influenced by the design principals of Permaculture. We started our project about five years ago by hosting a Permaculture Design Course, which concluded with an integrated Permaculture design for our property. Since then we have been working towards achieving the aims of that design, including earthen buildings, an edible food forest, a large kitchen garden and a broad acreage of fruit crops. We have also put in an extensive water harvesting swale system to help us return water to the watershed.\\xa0 During your time here you will be exposed to the principles and underlying ethics of permaculture. This is a great opportunity to get a taste for what it is all about.\\nWe also have a large kitchen garden which we are working on expanding. Our hope is to continue to produce a higher percentage of our own food each year. Participants will have the opportunity to take part in the happenins of garden the garden if they are interested.\\xa0 There are community members working with the garden that you are welcome to work with if you have that desire.\\xa0 The instructors of the internship will be focused almost exclusively on building, but the friendly folks of Panya would most likely be happy to have you help in the gardens if you like.\\nIn addition to all of these things, we have an a reservoir an easy 15 minute walk away for cooling off and swimming in at the end of each day, a beautiful forest around us, and two more wonderful communities next door, including a Thai cooking school and café that serves the best fruit shakes in Thailand.\\nCome and join us for these four weeks; We would love to have you.\\xa0 There is a possibility that you could stay on afterward as a volunteer, depending on space and other course scheduling.\\n\\xa0\\n----------------\\nCosts:\\n\\n4 week internship:………………………….30,000 Baht (US$990)\\n(attend both 4-week internships for 50,000 Baht (US$1650))\\nNGO rate*:………………………………………15,000 Baht (US$495)\\n\\xa0\\nWe ask all participants to pay a $200 deposit to secure your place.\\n*If you work for an NGO and believe that permaculture could help your organisation achieve its goals, please contact us about the NGO discounted rate.\\nThese prices include all meals and a place to stay for the duration of the course.\\n\\xa0\\n------------------------------------\\n\\xa0\\nRegister now by paying your $200 deposit above!\\n\\xa0\\nPlease don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions:\\nchristianshearer1 (at) gmail.com\\n\\xa0\\n———————\\n\\xa0\\nAbout the instructors:\\n\\xa0\\nOriginally from the Pacific Northwest of the United States, Christian Shearer helped found the Panya Project.

Call us at 250.469.1737\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nABOUT CYWC\\nWe know that you pour your life into kids, and we want to make sure you get some life poured back into you!\\n\\xa0\\nThe Canadian Youth Workers Convention is all about you. It’s a place where you can get a much-needed respite from your everyday (and evening!) duties as a youth worker. You’ll have a chance to be refreshed, renewed, and recharged. It’s an\\xa0opportunity\\xa0for you to connect with other people who understand your unique challenges and who are as committed to teenagers as you are. It’s a time for you to feed your soul, equip yourself for effective ministry, and come back to your ministry with energy, vision, and even more passion for impacting a generation of teens for the kingdom of God.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nFirst Things First - FUSE 2012\\nThis year CYWC will kick off with an exciting initiative designed to empower and release a generation of young emerging leaders. It’s a full day of guided interaction between veterans in ministry and young men and women who will make a significant kingdom difference. Investors will invite young leaders to join them in this day of thoughtful conversation, shared worship and some wild “outside-the-box” dreaming about how to transform our communities, our nation, and our world! If you’re a veteran leader who is investing in a few solid young men and women, we invite you to participate in this unique shared experience. If you’re a young leader who’s been blessed enough to have someone older and wiser pour into your life, let them know about this opportunity and come together\\n\\xa0\\nOnce the convention gets rolling you’ll find...\\n\\xa0\\nA Packed (or not-so-packed) Schedule\\nAt CYWC you’ll find plenty of time to get training in dozens of seminars, get inspired with five exhilarating Big Room sessions, kick back at late night specials, make new friends, or just get some time alone (whether that’s completely alone, alone with your spouse, or alone with God). Sometimes we all need to take a little time to care for ourselves, and this is a place where you can do that—guilt free!\\n\\xa0\\nOpportunities to Connect with God\\nIt’s ironic, isn’t it, that we often spend so much time talking about God to our kids that we forget to actually be with God ourselves? At CYWC we give you plenty of places and ways to connect with God. You may find that you reconnect with God in worship during our Big Room sessions (where you have zero responsibility for programming or playing guitar!), while spending time with a soul care team member, by sitting quietly in the prayer chapel in a quiet worship/prayer time…experiencing a connection to God that is unattainable in your everyday craziness of life.\\nChances to Connect with Others\\nWe know that youth ministry can sometimes be a lonely place. You’re misunderstood by most of the other adults in your church because you actually want to hang out with teenagers. At CYWC you’ll find hundreds of other people who are as crazy as you and who will embrace you with open arms! You’ll find opportunities to connect with other youth workers who share your passion for youth ministry. You will find other newbies or seasoned veterans. You will also find people who share a love for a specific area of ministry be it middle school, rural ministry, leading worship, discipleship, whatever. Participate in the Burning Issues Focus Groups, our Saturday afternoon dialog-centred shared experiences, chat with a speaker, artist, other youth workers or just strike up conversations and set up times for coffee or meals with new-found friends. Some people keep coming back to CYWC because of the relationships they’ve built over the years. It becomes like a family reunion (for a very strange, energetic, fun-loving kind of family!)\\nTraining, Training, Training\\nDid we mention that you can learn a lot of things at CYWC? We intentionally pack our schedule full of amazing seminars that are sure to help you with programming, leadership, understanding teens, care for your own soul, and so much more. You’ll find gifted speakers, professors, in-the-trenches youth workers, and thoughtful leaders teaching in the seminars. Whether you’ve been in ministry a few weeks or a few decades, we have something that will meet you where you are and provide practical help.\\nWe also cram our schedule full of seminars so that your church leaders will be impressed with all that you will learn, and will gladly send you to CYWC to be equipped to lead the youth group even better than you do right now! (Of course, if you get to CYWC and realize that you just need to reconnect with God or others, you can always get the seminars on CD or MP3…so you still go home with the lessons from all the training!)\\nExperts Who Want to Help You (for free)\\nSet up a one-on-one meeting with someone from the soul care team or a youth ministry coach. With our convention pastors, you can have deep, confidential conversations about issues you may be having in your church or in your own soul. Our youth ministry coaches will take the time to understand what struggles you may be dealing with in your youth group, and will help you lay out a plan to make the necessary changes. These are people who care deeply about youth ministry, but care even more about helping you as you are carrying out the work of youth ministry.\\nAn Event that Works for YOU and YOUR TEAM!\\nThere’s no wrong way to participate in the Canadian Youth Workers Convention (unless, of course, you don’t come!). So join hundreds of other youth workers for a time to celebrate your calling as a youth worker, be encouraged and equipped, and reconnect with the God who called you to this crazy, wonderful world of youth ministry.\\nCancellation Policy:\\nCancellations up to 30 days prior\\xa0to the event are subject to a $75 per person non-refundable cancellation fee.\\n\\nCancellations within 30 days of the event, or “no-shows,” will result in the forfeiture of the full payment.\\nIf forces beyond our control interrupt the Canadian Youth Workers Convention, your registration fee will be refunded less a pro-rated share of all costs incurred.\\nIf you are unable to attend, you may send a substitute to take your place by contacting the registrar at 1.250.469.1737.\\n\\n\\xa0',\n",

PMI uses subject matter experts from across the globe to help establish a point at which each candidate should pass the examination(s) and the examination point of difficulty. Data that shows how candidates actually performed is cross referenced with the subject matter experts to ensure that the point of difficulty on each examination is healthy.”\\xa0\\nPMI has not mentioned the exact passing score in the PMP Handbook. In sound psychometric analysis, the minimum mark of pass percentage varies for each exam, and is based on the exam's difficulty. It also means that if you get lots of easy questions on the exam, your pass percentage may be higher compared to the pass percentage if you get tougher questions correct. So one candidate may pass the exam scoring just 55%, and the other may fail despite scoring 65%.\\nAchieving\\xa080-90% on\\xa0practice exams\\xa0is good but certainly not enough. No one book can hold all the questions from thePMP exam to guarantee a 100% pass rate. Several times in our course it will be mentioned that our tests are not enough for the exam and students must to find other sources to try more tests. There are several free test websites to explore to 'Increase their chance of passing exam' - some of the students chose to pay a testing website to gain access to more simulations.

Die Anreise per Schiff gleicht einer kleinen Kreuzfahrt und die Faröer Inseln sind ein lohnender Zwischenstop. Natur im Urzustand findet man hier und in Island. Überwältigende Wasserfälle inmitten grüner Oasen wechseln sich ab mit Lavawüsten, die durch Farben und Formen begeistern. Geysire und Europas größte Gletscher liegen auf engsten Raum zusammen. Die Durchquerung des Hochlandes per Rad, unter teilweise extremen Bedingungen, war die größte Herausforderung der Flecks. Trekkingtouren zwischen Askja und Herdubreid, am Kverkfjöll, im Skaftafjell Nationalpark und in der farbenprächtigen Bergwelt von Landmannalaugur waren unvergeßliche Naturerlebnisse. Der Gegenpol zu so viel Natur ist Reykjavik, die nördlichste Hauptstadt der Welt. Hier ist man up to date und quasi um die Ecke liegt die Blaue Lagune, eine Wellnessoase die vom Abwasser eines geothermischen Kraftwerks gespeist wird. Modernste Technik nutzt die geothermische Energie und das riesige Potential an Wasserkraft in Island. In einer mitreißenden, live kommentierten Panoramashow erleben Sie eines der letzten Naturparadiese Europas.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nJetzt bestellen unter:\\xa0www.michael-fleck.de\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Drawing on her rich Mediterranian heritage she creates contemporary songs with haunting melody and lyrical depth. While her early influences come from the singer songwriter tradition of the likes of Sandy Denny,Joni Mitchell and Leonard Cohen, over time due to her passion for italian regional folksong,she has absorbed influence from the East with its modal tones and ecstatic singing styles of Indian,Arabic, Southern Italian and Gypsy influenced song and links these with western folk music influences.Other influences that have made an impression on Kavisha\\'s music are her interest in meditation and mysticism through the teachings of Osho ,Sufi ,Tibetan Buddhist Masters and Advaita teachings.Kavisha leads a chanting singing group called Empty Sky. Warmth and humour spice her performance.

That day, her son Johnny was delivering his Des Moines Register Sunday edition paper, when two men approched him and he was thrown into a vehicle and kidnapped. When help from local authorties and the FBI waned, Noreen took it upon herself and her own private investigation to find out the truth about her son... learning that he was kidnapped as part of a global pedofile and pornography ring. \\nFor the past 30 years, Noreen has not only been dedicated to trying to locate Johnny, but also to making the world safer for children by bringing national attention to these networks of pedophile and pornography rings -- all through her work with The Johnny Gosch Foundation.\\n\\nIn her book, \"Why Johnny Can\\'t Come Home\" Noreen shares about her unexpected visit from Johnny in 1997... and she gives a reviting account of everything she has learned connected to the case, including shocking truths about the lies and cover-ups commited by those we expect to protect us.\\n\\nJoin us as we kick off WOW 2013... you will be inspired by Noreen\\'s story of strength and determination to seek the truth and make a difference in the lives of others.\\n\\nYou can help turn the one-hour special \"Missing Johnny\" into a full-length, uncensored film. \\nClick here to find out how to make a pledge and receive an advanced copy of the film.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nNoreen Gosch\\nFounder, The Johnny Gosch Foundation\\xa0 \\n\\n\\nIn 1982, Noreen founded The Johnny Gosch Foundation and developed a program called \"In Defense of Children,\" which she presents all over the U.S. reaching thousands of people. In addition, she wrote the \"Johnny Gosch Bill\" that passed into law in Iowa on July 1, 1984. Shortly after, Missouri and 7 other states adopted the bill and renamed it \"The Johnny Gosch Law\" which provides the immediate involvement of police when a child is missing, rather than waiting 72-hours. \\n\\xa0\\nNoreen has made numerous network TV appearances, as well as traveled to Washington D.C. and testified for senate hearings and the U.S. Justice Department (where she secured the first funding to establish The Center for Missing & Exploited Children).\\n\\nNoreen continues to work with the State Legislature, the Governor of Iowa and remains involved on the federal level.

Workshop # 4, TRANSFORMING MOVEMENTS, will transcend and include each of the previous three LS workshops. We will feature 10 new microstructures to spread your transformation efforts.\\n\\nIn this roll-up-your-sleeves immersion workshop, you will learn and immediately practice 8-10 Liberating Structures. A practical understanding of most individual LS microstructures can be developed in less than one hour each. This is enough to go out and try them in operational settings with little risk. LS users act their way into new thinking rather than thinking their way into new acting.\\nJoin us in Seatle on Thursday, April 4th for the day-long Liberating Structures: TRANSFORMING MOVEMENTS workshop (8:15am-4:30pm).

Please bring your bathing suits with you.\\nPool Pass: Includes use of locker room, towels.\\nPasses are not refundable. Exchanges are not permitted.\\nEveryone must be 21 and over to enter the venue.\\nThe Grace Hotel, located in Times Square, has done a reputable job at staying under the radar. The feature that separates this venue from other NYC hotels and has us boasting is its 22-foot heated indoor pool with a swim-up bar. This isn’t a conventional indoor pool for families with kids, however, it’s bordered by stadium seating accompanied by tables, which offer the option for bottle service. Where there’s a pool, there are bathing suits. If you’re not interested in getting wet, you can always sit and watch. However, if you’re willing to try something new and get a little wet while at a bar we can guarantee you’ll be surrounded by hot men and women. In case you forget your bathing suit, the venue sells disposable suits outside of the pool entrance. However, we did see women get in the pool in their under garments. To go along with the nightlife vibe, there is a projection screen above the swim-up bar which coincides with the live DJ the hotel provides five nights a week. At the swim-up bar, pool inhabitants can see through the bar to the opposite side of the inside bar. However, seeing as though the bar goes through, the bartenders must attend to the inside guests as well as the pool guests. This presents our only complaint. The bartenders fall short of service when it comes to the swim-up bar. You’ll find three to four people at a time waiting behind the swim-up bar to have their order taken. Halfway throughout the night the venue supplies the pool with numerous blow up balls. Just when you thought things were getting hot and heavy, venture to the third floor of the indoor pool-room and you’ll find showers, a sauna and a steam room. It seems as though this venue thought of it all. The Grace Hotel is in a great location. It has a feature that no other hotel in NYC offers, and we recommend this venue to anyone who is up for a wet and wild experience not easily found in NYC\",\n",

Join us for Move, Play & Learn. \\n\\xa0\\nWe are inviting children aged 18 months to 5 years to participate in our program, encouraging active play and educating you and your child on how important physical activity is at an early age.\\n\\n\\xa0Did you know that current research is increasingly finding that children pre-school are unskilled at basic movements such as throwing, running and jumping? A recent study (Paediatrics, 2012) reported that by year 2 most children should have mastered a basic sprint, vertical jump, side gallop and leap. Unfortunately the results did not reflect this with only 10% of the sample group demonstrating all four skills.\\nDid you know that parents mistakenly believe that children naturally learn fundamental movement skills when in fact children must be taught them? Consequently, without this confidence & body familiarity, children are less likely to participate in organised or school sport or even play with their friends. Children lacking the four basic movement skills also had had lower fitness levels & were more prone to being overweight or obese. Early childhood is a critical period for the development of fundamental movement skills & studies suggest early intervention is key.\\n\\n\\nOur program will start Monday July 15 and run until Monday September 16 (inclusive)\\n\\nOur program will not run on Monday August 5 and Monday September 9.
